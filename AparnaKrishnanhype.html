Inked November 2021<br>

<br>Location: Brooklyn, New York</br>

<br>Location on body:one on each arm</br>

<p>
I have tattoos of both of my grandparents’ signatures on each of my arms. This is sentimental to me because my grandparents play a huge role in my life. Every day they inspire me to be a better person and their dynamic gives me hope for my future relationships. Their signatures to them are their “identity”. Since they come from a much older generation, they believed that their signature was the key that gave others access to important things of their’s. So the two of them took years to master the perfect and most intricate signatures that are difficult to replicate. I asked my mother to get their signatures for me and then surprised them by showing the finished tattoo to them later, to which they were so happy that they even began to cry. To me, this tattoo means that I can forever carry their mark on me physically and emotionally as well. I will always have my loving grandparents watch over me and be a part of my life until I die.
