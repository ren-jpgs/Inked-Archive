With great intensity this specific tattoo came to mind when it came to sentiment or striking relevancy in my life.. so here it goes! In late winter 2019 my grandfather was slowly fading out of life, and due to that, I had been spending a lot of time thinking back on his life — one particular artifact of life is his time as a fisherman back in Greece. For that, I found myself sketching some fish for the hell of it, with not much thought behind it. With his passing, my mom brought up the idea of getting one of the fish tattooed together in his memory, of which we planned for that spring.. though halted due to the pandemic (though I must note, I didn’t really plan on inking myself with my own sketches — but this was a cause worthy of so for me). Looking forward to the fall of that year, my mother was thinking a lot about her father once again, mostly due to him traveling into her dreams at night, of which lead her to consider reaching out to my godmother Maureen, (who just so happens to be) a medium. Alas, life got in the way, and she forgot to call, until Maureen had actually reached out to her and asked to chat if she had the time. A phone call next, in which they got to review a moment where my grandfather had come through to her. With that, mention of sailing songs, old memories past, and with most distinction.. the mention of “they were supposed to get something ..they never got it.” This had left Maureen confused, though, as she relayed the message.. my mom knew exactly what it was in reference to. Alas, here I stand, with the sketch of the fish on my arm!
