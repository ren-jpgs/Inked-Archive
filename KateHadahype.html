Most of my tattoos have been whatever I felt getting that day, I enjoy the spontaneous feeling of getting something permanent. Even if I don’t love it in 20 years I see my tattoos as a timeline of my interests and what the culture was like at the time. My favorite is my cupid tattoo on my left collarbone. I was running on no sleep, with my sister and best friend scrolling through Pinterest trying to find the perfect design. We were there for three hours and I spent that entire time panicking in the bathroom because I couldn’t settle on a placement. Five minutes before I went under the needle, I found the most sexy angel tattoo. However I was terrified since it was going above my collarbone. I could hear my moms voice saying “How are you gonna get a job with that?” But I just said fuck it and decided to do it. Next thing I know I woke up with a giant angel tattoo, because I fell asleep throughout the entire process. Today it’s my favorite tattoo since I don’t remember feeling it at all. I also have a pixie, vivienne westwood logo, and death note tattoo.
